## Sec. 7 5G Mid-Band vs. 5G mmWave
___

### Key Insight or Takeaway
> A quantitative analysis of the 5G channel variability between 5G Mib-Band and mmWave under mobility reveals
> why many consider 5G Mid-Band as the "Sweet spot" deployment of choice. 

### Results Summary

1. Figure 18: The throughput and channel parameters variability (in terms on MCS and Mimo layers) of 5G
Mid-band is more stable than 5G mmWave's under both walking and driving. In other words, mmWave fluctuates
4x more than 5G Mid-band.

2. Figure 19: mmWave 5G exhibits significantly higher throughput and QoE bitrate at the expense of longer
stall times when compared with 5G Mid-Band. This is as a result of the highly variably (4x more) channel
parameters in mmWave when compared to 5G Mid-Band.

### Generating plot
In the project terminal, navigate to this folder and run:

1. Figure 18: ```jupyter notebook fig18.ipynb ```
2. Figure 19: ```jupyter notebook fig19.ipynb ```

Then run the ``>>`` to _'Restart the kernel and run all cells'_
