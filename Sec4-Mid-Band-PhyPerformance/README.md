## Sec. 4 5G Mid-Band PHY Performance
___

### Key Insight or Takeaway
> We find disparities in the attainable DL throughput
> and pinpoint the root cause not to the channel bandwidth or 
> resource utilization (RBs), but to MCS and MIMO layers 
> configurations. UL throughput and latency are coupled to the TDD frame 
> structure configured. As radio resources are usually fully utilized 
> in mid-bands, further performance optimization gains can only 
> come by better adapting to channel propagation characteristics.
