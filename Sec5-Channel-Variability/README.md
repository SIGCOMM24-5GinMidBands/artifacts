## Sec. 5 5G Mid-Band Channel Variability
___

### Key Insight or Takeaway
> We introduce scaled variability metrics to characterize the 5G Mid-Band channel
> dynamics. Particularly, we show that the aggregate (e.g., average/distributions of)
> performance metrics (and associated parameters) are not sufficient in characterizing
> 5G channels; the variability (over time) provides another critical dimension to capture
> channel dynamics in 5G Mid-Band and beyond. 

### Results Summary

1. Figure 12: We use four European operators; Vodafone Italy (V_It), Vodafone Spain (V_Sp), 
Orange Spain (O_Sp) with 90 Mhz and Orange Spain (O_Sp) with 100 Mhz 5G Mid-Band 
channels to show that the 5G Mid-band PHY layer throughput turns to stabilize around 400ms.

2. Figure 13: Using V_It, we illustrate the effect that 5G PHY layer parameter variability has on the throughput.
Specifically, when the 5G PHY parameters changes frequently, the throughput tends to be lower and vice versa.

3. Figure 14: We further study how the 5G PHY layer parameter variability changes around locations and users. 
Channel variability tends to be higher when a user is far away from the gNB.
